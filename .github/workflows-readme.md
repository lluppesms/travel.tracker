## Set up GitHub Actions

The GitHub workflows in this project require several secrets set at the repository level or at the environment level.

---

## Workflow Definitions

- **[1-deploy-bicep.yml](./workflows/1-deploy-bicep.yml):** Deploys the main.bicep template with all new resources and does nothing else
- **[2.1-bicep-build-deploy-webapp.yml](./workflows/2.1-bicep-build-deploy-webapp.yml):** Builds an Azure Web App and deploys it to Azure
- **[4-build-deploy-dacpac.yml](./workflows/4-build-deploy-dacpac.yml):** Builds the database schema and deploys it to the SQL database
- **[5-run-sql-script.yml](./workflows/5-run-sql-script.yml):** Runs a SQL script against the Azure SQL Database
- **[6-pr-scan-build.yml](./workflows/6-pr-scan-build.yml):** Runs a build every pull request to ensure the code builds and passes all tests
- **[7-scan-code.yml](./workflows/7-scan-code.yml):** Periodically runs a security scan on the application and infrastructure code.
- **[8-smoke-test-webapp.yml](./workflows/8-smoke-test-webapp.yml):** Runs a Playwright smoke test of the web application after deployment

---

## Sequence of Workflows

When you first create the application, you will have to deploy the application using one of the workflows that deploy bicep, then update the new database so that the pipelines have rights to deploy the database schema and data.  After those rights have been granted, run the deploy DACPAC workflow to deploy the database schema and populate the database with some starter data.  After that, you can use any of the workflows to deploy your application and database updates.

---

## Azure Credentials

Before you begin, you will need to set up the Azure Credentials secrets in the GitHub Secrets at the Repository level (or the environment level).  These secrets and credentials will allow the GitHub Actions to deploy into Azure.

See the **[CreateGitHubSecrets.md](./CreateGitHubSecrets.md)** file for info on how to create the a service principal and set up the Federated Credentials.

Once the credentials are set up, you can customize and run the following commands, or you can set these secrets up manually by going to the Settings -> Secrets -> Actions -> Secrets.

You can set these up at the Repository Level...

```bash
gh secret set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID -b <yourAzureSubscriptionId>
gh secret set AZURE_TENANT_ID -b <GUID-Entra-tenant-where-SP-lives>
gh secret set CICD_CLIENT_ID -b <GUID-application/client-Id>
```

but it's probably better to set up one set of credentials for each Environment:

```bash
gh secret set --env <ENV-NAME> AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID -b <yourAzureSubscriptionId>
gh secret set --env <ENV-NAME> AZURE_TENANT_ID -b <GUID-Entra-tenant-where-SP-lives>
gh secret set --env <ENV-NAME> CICD_CLIENT_ID -b <GUID-application/client-Id>
```

These two secrets are optional for this application if you want to grant an administrator access to the Key Vault and Container Registry and SQL database.  

```bash
gh secret set ADMIN_IP_ADDRESS 192.168.1.1
gh secret set ADMIN_PRINCIPAL_ID <yourGuid>
```

---

## Database Security

In order for the workflows to be able to update the database, you must grant rights to the CICD service principal and the application managed identity in the database.

Grant full rights to your CICD Service Principal so it can deploy the DACPAC schema:

```sql
CREATE USER [yourServicePrincipalName] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
ALTER ROLE db_owner ADD MEMBER [yourServicePrincipalName];
```

Grant user rights to your application managed identity so it can read and write data (not change the schema):

```sql
CREATE USER [yourAppManagedIdentityName] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON SCHEMA::[Travel] TO [yourAppManagedIdentityName];
GRANT EXECUTE ON SCHEMA::[Travel] TO [yourAppManagedIdentityName];
```

Once these rights are in place, before the application can run successfully, then you can deploy the SQL database schema and data using the [DACPAC deployment workflow](./workflows/4-build-deploy-dacpac.yml) and the [SQL script workflow](./workflows/5-run-sql-script.yml).  In the SQL Script workflow, choose the [InsertDefaultData.sql](../src/sql.database/Patch/InsertDefaultData.sql) script to populate the database with some starter data.

## Bicep Configuration Values

There are other values used by the Bicep templates to configure the resource names that are deployed. Make sure the App_Name variable is unique to your deployment. It will be used as the basis for the application name and for all the other Azure resources, some of which must be globally unique.

See the **[CreateGitHubSecrets.md](./CreateGitHubSecrets.md)** file for the full list of commands to create these variables and secrets.
